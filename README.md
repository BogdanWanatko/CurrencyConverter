This is a simple console application that allows you to convert a certain amount of money from one currency to another.

To use the app:

Enter the amount you want to convert
Enter the code of the source currency (e.g. USD, EUR, GBP, PLN)
Enter the code of the target currency (e.g. USD, EUR, GBP, PLN)
The app will then use an API to retrieve the exchange rate and display the converted amount.

Note
This application uses a free API that provides exchange rates. The accuracy of the exchange rates may vary.
